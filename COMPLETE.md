2. Choose a platform (Render recommended)
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy!
5. Share your live URL

### For Assignment Submission

1. Make sure all files are committed:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fixed all 6 bugs - production ready"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Test one final time:
   - Run all 10 tests in [TESTING_GUIDE.md](./TESTING_GUIDE.md)
   - Make sure no errors in console
   - Verify navigation appears correctly

3. Create a `.env.example` for your instructor ✅ (already done!)

4. Add deployment info to your portfolio README:

   ```markdown
