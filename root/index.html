      <h3>Welcome to the Marvel API Explorer <br> Gambit Edition</h3>
      <p>This project pulls live data directly from Marvel's developer API. All information you’ll see here is dynamically fetched in real time and centers around one of the most stylish, misunderstood, and complex characters in the Marvel Universe: Gambit.
      </p>
      <em>Click any of the Comics, Series, or Events at the top of the page to explore the stories Gambit has appeared in. Each section loads a list of twenty entries at a time; titles, short descriptions, and links that take you straight to Marvel’s official page for more detail.</em>
      <h3>Meet Remy LeBeau</h3>
      <p>Born in New Orleans and raised by the Thieves Guild after being kidnapped as a baby, Gambit was always meant to walk between worlds. He was called "Le Diable Blanc" (The White Devil), a child of prophecy said to unite the feuding Thieves and Assassins Guilds of Louisiana. Smooth-talking, card-slinging, and always playing the odds, Gambit became one of the most compelling anti-heroes in X-Men lore.</p>
      <p>What made him stand out? For me, it was everything — the trench coat, the red-on-black eyes, that heavy French Creole accent, and the way he moved through shadows like silk. Growing up in Mississippi, I saw Gambit as a kind of myth, not just a hero, but a symbol of charisma, controlled chaos, and a dash of rebellion. The way he flipped a playing card like a shuriken, the way he could charge it with raw kinetic energy and it detonate like a mortar, so cool as a kid in the 90's.</p>
      <p>And then there’s the staff. A simple Bo staff, not a flashy weapon — but wielded with a suave dexterity and slick intent. It said: I don’t need to kill you to win, but I will laugh as I walk away.</p> 

      <h3>His Powers</h3>
      <p>Gambit has the ability to charge objects with kinetic energy, causing them to explode on impact. He prefers lightweight items like cards because they’re fast and easy to throw, but in truth, he can charge anything. A playing card becomes a grenade. A staff strike can level a house. His body, constantly radiating bio-kinetic energy, enhances his agility, reflexes, and balance beyond human limits. He can leap, twist, and disappear like a magician in combat. And beneath it all, there's a quiet protection, a static shield that even the world’s strongest telepaths can’t penetrate.</p>
      <p>He also has something deeper: a hypnotic charm. A real one. It’s part power, part personality, an aura that makes people want to believe him, trust him, follow him. He once convinced the Shadow King himself. But it doesn’t work if you know it’s happening — and that’s part of what makes it dangerous.</p>

      <h3>The Love Story</h3>
      <p>No summary of Gambit is complete without Rogue. Their relationship has been one of the longest-running and most emotionally loaded pairings in Marvel comics. Rogue couldn’t touch anyone without absorbing their power and memories, but Gambit? He still tried. He flirted, seduced, joked, and teased. And beneath the charm, he was sincere. He loved her, even when it hurt. And she loved him back.</p>
      <p>They were a fire that couldn’t be held. Always burning, always pulling at each other from opposite ends of danger and desire. Together, they weren’t perfect — but they were real.</p>

      <h3>Legacy</h3>
      <p>Even without a successful solo movie, Gambit remains a fan favorite. He’s ranked in top 10 X-Men lists, “sexiest” character polls, and has shown up in games, cartoons, and cameos for decades. He’s the wildcard that always gets played last, the character that walks the edge between the shadows and the spotlight.</p>
      <p>This app is for him. It’s for the parts of us that live in rebellion, in finesse, in charm, and in risk.</p>
